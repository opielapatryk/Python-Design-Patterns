# Python-Design-Patterns

# Python-Specific Patterns
## Providing a centralized point of access for certain functionalities or resources, used in conjunction with Singleton ensures that only one instance of the object exists throughout the program lifecycles
Global Object Pattern<br>
## A powerful technique for offering callables at the top level of your module that share state through a common object
Prebound Method Pattern<br>
## We use -1 instead of null i.e. if a.find(x) is -1: return 
Sentinel Object Pattern<br>

# Creational Patterns
## Abstract Factory
solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.<br>

## Singleton
better use Global Object Pattern

## Prototype
can be easily recognized by copy methods

## Builder 
useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options i.e. "reports generator"
